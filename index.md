Heya!!! Kunal here, people call me by yagami sometimes. I Completed my undergraduate studies in the field of Electronics and Communication from [IIITD](https://iiitd.ac.in/) in year 2019. Although the degree says ECE, I found my interest in the field of Computer Science.

What attracted me to this field was the sheer problem solving required, deep diving into the problems and thinking out the solutions. Apart from that, I like digging my way around different technologies to make sense of how a particular thing works.

My areas of Interests are
- Computer Networking
- Operating System (Unix / Linux)
- Concurrent, parallel and distributed systems
- Security

Hobbies
- Playing video games (Focused on Ubisoft's Rainbow Six Seige right now).
- Reading Books.
- Watching Friends (Watched it way too many times), Netflix and Anime.
- Listen to all kinds of song (Hindi, English, K-POP, J-POP).

Somethings I would like to do in future
- Contribute to opensource community or start a opensource project of my own.
- Travel all around the world and hopefully find some obscure places.
