My name is Kunal Sharma. Completed my undergraduate studies in the field of Electronics and Communication from [IIITD](https://iiitd.ac.in/) in year 2019. Although the degree says ECE, I found my interest in the field of Computer Science. What attracted me to this field was the sheer problem solving required, deep diving in the problems to figure out a solution and digging my way around different technologies to make sense of how a particular thing works.

My areas of Interests are
- Computer Networking
- Operating System (Unix / Linux)
- Concurrent, parallel and distributed systems
- Security

Hobbies
- Playing video games (Focused on Ubisoft's Rainbow Six Seige right now)
- Reading Books
- Watching Friends (Watched it way too many times), Netflix and Anime
- Listen to all kinds of song (Hindi, English, K-POP, J-POP)

Somethings I would like to do in future
- Travel all around the world and hopefully find obscure places
